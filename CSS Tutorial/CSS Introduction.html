<h1>My First CSS Example</h1>
<p>CSS Solved a Big Problem
    HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
    
    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    
    h1 This is a heading
    
    p This is a paragraph. p
    
    When tags like font , and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    
    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    
    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page
